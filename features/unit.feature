Feature: Mocking and Utility Functions
  As a developer
  I want to use mock objects and utility functions
  So that I can test my code effectively without dependencies

  Scenario: Using a mock object
    Given a mock object is created
    When the mock object is called
    Then it should return the expected result

  Scenario: Using a utility function
    Given a utility function is available
    When I call the utility function
    Then it should return the correct output
